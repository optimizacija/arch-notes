# Introduction
Followng these tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ

# Chainlink
Chainlink is a decentralized oracle. centralized oracles would be single point of failure for decentralized networks.
- brings data to blockchain or executes some kind of computation
- provides an interface with real world data

# Hybrid contracts
contracts that talk to the outside world are called hybrid contracts.

Dapp = Smart contract = Decentralized app

# DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization
- live in contracts
- perform governance onchain - accept voting decisions on what to do


# Faucet
- application that gives us free test tokens like ETH on ropsten network

# Gas
- measure of computation use

- gas price: how much it costs per unit of gas
- gas limit: max amount of gas in a transaction
- transaction fee: Gas used * gas price

21000 gas @ 1 GWEI per gas = 21000 GWEI


# keys & account id
private public key pair is generated on ETH with ECDSA algorithm
- (private is random and public is derived)

account id is generated by using ETH's keccak256 hashing algorithm on top of your public key
that is used for signing transactions

private key generates > public key generates > address

# Consesus 
- how to agree on the same state in decentralized system

## 1. Chain selection
How do we know which blockchain is the real/true blockchain?
- on eth & bitcoin we use longest chain rule 
  - the longest blockchain is the real one.

block confirmations - how many blocks were added on top after your transaction 

PoW + longest chain rule together create the Nakamoto Consesus
- used by ETH 1 & Blockchain

## 2. Sybil Resistance
- system for blockchains to prevent malicious users from creating a large number of fake identities / nodes
- proof of work / stake

### PoW
- mining
no matter how many fake users you create, you still need to provide PoW for each of them. 
So you can't really easily fake your nodes

- costs electricity -> environmental impact

### PoS
PoS nodes put collateral in the blockchain
- that they're going to behave honestly
if they missbehave, they're going to be slashed/removed from the network 
and their staked funds will be taken away from them

validators are randomly chosen which one is going to propose a valid block
- and other nodes validate
blockchains are deterministic, so we can't truly use random validators
- ETH 2 uses "randout", this is a DAO that collectively chooses a random validator

-> considered slightly less decentralized network due to staking cost 
that's needed for participation

# Attacks
## Sybil attack
- user creates a tonne of psuedo accounts to influence a network

difficult on PoW blockchains because user would need to do a lot of mining

## 51% attack
if you contain the longest chain & you have 51% of the network nodes you can
create a fork of the network and bring the network on your longest chain

# Scalability
Gas prices fluctuate. The bigger the demand (the more transactions are requested at the same time),
the bigger gas prices become. 
This is not scalable, because more people are wanting to get inside the same block 
and they're pushing each other out while raising the gas price.
There's a ceiling to how many people can use the system,
because as gas prices keep rising, people won't be able to afford to perform transactions on the blockchain.

# Sharding

Blockchain of blockchains. There's a mainchain which coordinates all these other smaller blockchains. 
This increses the amount of effective block space that there is,
so more people can trade at lower cost/waiting times.

# Layers
layer 1
any base layer blockchain implementation
- BTC, ETH, Avalanche

layer 2
any applicaiton build on top of layer 1 
- chainlink, arbitrum, optimism
    - arbitrum & optimism are rollups - they rollup their transaction into layer 1 ETH


# Contracts

## visibility modifiers:
public, private, internal, external:
- external - cannot be called within the same contract
- internal - can only be called with other function inside the same contract
- private - only visible within the same contract and not from derived contracts
    - like external + forbidden access from derived contracts

default visibility is internal

making fields public, make them visible, but they're still readonly,
(fields can only be changed within functions?)

State changing functions are transactions

## functions that do not require transactions
keywords - view & pure
view - reads some state but does not change it
    - public variables are also "view functions"
pure - purely do some type of math (no reading of state)
    - eg "squareNumber(x) -> x * x"
