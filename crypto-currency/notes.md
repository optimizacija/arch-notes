## Chainlink
Chainlink is a decentralized oracle. centralized oracles would be single point of failure for decentralized networks.
- brings data to blockchain or executes some kind of computation
- provides an interface with real world data

## Hybrid contracts
contracts that talk to the outside world are called hybrid contracts.

Dapp = Smart contract = Decentralized app

# DAO - Decentralized Autonomous Organization
- live in contracts
- perform governance onchain - accept voting decisions on what to do


# Faucet
- application that gives us free test tokens like ETH on ropsten network

# Gas
- measure of computation use

- gas price: how much it costs per unit of gas
- gas limit: max amount of gas in a transaction
- transaction fee: Gas used * gas price

21000 gas @ 1 GWEI per gas = 21000 GWEI
